# xtn
xtn stands for eXtensible Text Notation. It is a format for defining "objects" in text - useful for configuration or some kinds of DSLs. The main goal of the format is to avoid escaping rules for values enabling easy definition of file paths, regular expressions, code fragments in any language, etc. This format was created because none of the options in widespread use (such as JSON, XML, YAML, TOML, INI) work well enough for this purpose.

## Implementations
Python - xtn package
